When dealing with Kilobot voltage levels, there are a few important things to keep in mind and understand:

1. Minimum and maximum voltage levels:
    - The Kilobot has a minimum voltage of around 2.2V, below which its behavior may become unstable,
    and it may not operate as expected.
    - On the other hand, the maximum voltage is around 3.6V, beyond which the Kilobot's components may get damaged,
    and it may not function properly.

2. Battery voltage measurement:
    - To measure the battery voltage, you can use the get_voltage() function provided by kilolib.
    - This function returns the current battery voltage in millivolts.

3. Voltage level indication:
    - To indicate the battery voltage level on the Kilobot, you can use the built-in RGB LED.
    - You can set the LED color based on the current battery voltage using a code snippet similar
    to the one provided in the previous answer.

4. Battery life:
    - The battery life of a Kilobot depends on various factors such as the usage pattern,
    motor activity, LED usage, etc.
    - It is important to keep track of the battery level and recharge the Kilobot when necessary to ensure optimal performance.

5. Battery replacement:
    - When replacing the Kilobot battery, ensure that the replacement battery has the same
    voltage rating as the original battery and is of good quality.
    - It is also important to follow the manufacturer's instructions for battery replacement to avoid damaging the Kilobot.

By keeping these things in mind and understanding the Kilobot voltage levels, you can ensure the proper
functioning and longevity of your Kilobots.
